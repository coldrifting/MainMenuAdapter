# Main Menu Converter
Converts Main Menu replacer meshes for Skyrim to work with my Main Menu Randomizer SKSE Plugin

Since many Main Menu meshes reuse the same model and just edit the image it points to, trying to use more than one
with my new plugin could be annoying, as you would have to go into nifskope for each one and redirect the paths.

To avoid that, I created this application that does it automatically for you. 
Simply drag a zip file of the mod you want to convert onto the exe, 
type in a unique name to give to the model and texture, and viola! 
You now have a zip file you can import into Mod Organizer 2 just like that.
